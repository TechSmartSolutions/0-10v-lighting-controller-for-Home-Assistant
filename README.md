# 0-10v PWM LED Dimming Controller (includes Home Assistant Integration)

This repository provides the code and instructions to build a custom LED dimming controller using 0-10v pulse-width modulation (PWM) technology including the code and setup to integrate with Home Assistant. The controller allows for precise adjustment of LED light brightness and is a cost-effective and personalized solution compared to commercially available dimming options.  Includes stl for 3D printed case.
