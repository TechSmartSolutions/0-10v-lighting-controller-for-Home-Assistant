# 24-Channel Digital 0-10v PWM Home Assistant Dimming controller for High Powered LED Drivers

**If you are looking for Analog 0-10v control**, check out <a href="https://github.com/TechSmartSolutions/12-or-24-Channel-Home-Assistant-LED-Driver-dimmer-for-High-Powered-LED-Drivers/discussions/2">the 0-10v Analog Dimming discussion thread</a> for more info.  If you have a driver that supports 0-10v analog dimming (MEANWELL drivers included) it may make more sense not to build this controller and use the option provided in tge 0-10v analog thread instead.

### Here is the schematic for the version that has been tested and working with MEANWELL 3-in-1 LED drivers and Home Assistant

## !!!!! Everything below this header needs to be revised, proceed at your own risk!  The information below was written for the TLC59711 which is not currently supported by Home Assistant.  Any lost time/money resulting from following any information below in this guide is your own fault!  I will have this updated as soon as I have a chance.
