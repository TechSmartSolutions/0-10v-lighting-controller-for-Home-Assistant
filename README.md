# DIY 0-10v PWM LED Dimming Controller

This repository provides the code and instructions to build a custom LED dimming controller using 0-10v pulse-width modulation (PWM) technology including the code and setup to integrate with Home Assistant. The controller allows for precise adjustment of LED light brightness and is a cost-effective and personalized solution compared to commercially available dimming options.

## Parts Needed
- Adafruit 24-Channel 12-bit PWM LED Driver - SPI Interface - TLC5947 or Adafruit 12-Channel 16-bit PWM LED Driver - SPI Interface - TLC59711
- ESP32, ESP8266, Arduino, Raspberry Pi or other device with SPI pins (this project is using a cheap Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266)
- 10v AC/DC Wall Plug Adapter with male 5.5 mm x 2.5 mm end
- DC Power cable with female 5.5 mm x 2.5 mm end
- LM2596 DC to DC Voltage Regulator 4-40V to 1.5-35V Buck Converter with LED Display
- 2x joinable 400 Pin breadboards with removable power rails
- 2x Break-Away 0.1" 2x20-pin Strip Dual Male Headers or 8 3x2 pin groups
- 12 or 24 2.1mm x 5.5mm DC Power Pigtail connectors (one set for each channel)
- Dupont Ratchet Crimping Tool Kit
- _wagos/wirenuts_
