## this goes below the captivate_portal section of your ESP device yaml 

tlc5947:
  # if you used different pins than the example project, ensure these are set correctly.
  data_pin: GPIO16 
  clock_pin: GPIO14
  lat_pin: GPIO12

## the min_power is set in this sketch to 0, but for mine I had to adjust that variable for each channel. Some of the channels for some reason wouldn't light the leds unless the slider was set above 0, so I did a test-and-check process to figure out what to set the min_output for each output channel.
